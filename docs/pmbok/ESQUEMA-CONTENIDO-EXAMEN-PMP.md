# DOMAINS, TASKS, AND ENABLERS

This document provides details about the structure for the PMP Certification Exam Content Outline (ECO), including domains, tasks, and enablers as defined by the JTA.

- Domain: Defined as the high-level knowledge area that is essential to the practice of project management.
- Tasks: The underlying responsibilities ofthe project manager within each domain area.
- Enablers: Illustrative examples of the work associated with the task. Please note that enablers are not meant to be an exhaustive list but rather offer a few examples to help demonstrate what the task encompasses.

Each PMP certification exam will include questions that address all tasks for a domain, and PMI will
adhere to the percentage of coverage at the domain level as outlined on the previous page.

Below is an example of the task structure:

- Domain: People
- Task statement: Help ensure knowledge transfer
- Enablers:
    - Identify knowledge critical to the project
    - Gather knowledge
    - Foster an environment for knowledge transfer

The ECO is in alignment with the PMI Thought Leadership report, Maximizing Project Success: Elevating the
impact of the project profession. Elevating the impact on our world research, where the result was
reframing project success to build upon the traditional metrics like schedule, budget, and scope—the
hallmarks of project management success—to a broader perspective that encompasses stakeholder value
and accomplishment of desired outcomes. This extensive research contributed to a new, consensus view of
the definition of project success when the project was perceived to have delivered value that was worth
the effort and expense.
