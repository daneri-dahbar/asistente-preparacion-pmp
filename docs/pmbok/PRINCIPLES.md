# Principles

One of the most noticeable changes in PMBOK 7 is the shift from a process-based approach to a principle-based approach. In previous editions, the PMBOK Guide was highy focused on prescribing specific processes for managing projects, with detailed explanations of inputs, tools, techniques, and outputs for each process. While this approach was thorough, it was often criticized for being too rigid and not adaptable to the diverse nature of modern projects.

In PMBOK 7, PMI moves towards a more flexible and adaptable approach by focusing on principles instead of strict processes. These principles are designed to guide project managers in making decisions that area relevant to their specific projects, allowing for greater flexibility based on project size, scope, and context.

The twelve core principles in PMBOK 7 include:

1. Stewardship: Acting responsibly and ethically in managing project resources.
2. Team: Building a high-performing, collaborative project team.
3. Stakeholders: Understanding and engaging with stakeholders effectively.
4. Value: Maximizing the value delivered by the project.
5. Systems Thinking: Understanding that a project is a complex system with interconnected elements.
6. Leadership: Providing clear vision, guidance, and support for the project team.
7. Tailorin: Tailoring project management approaches to meet the specific needs of the project.
8. Quality: Managing project quality to meet or exceed stakeholder expectations.
9. Complexity: Navigating and managing project complexity effectively.
10. Risk: Managing uncertainty and mitigating risks.
11. Adaptability and Resilience: Being adaptable and resilent in responding to project changes and challenges.
12. Change Management: Managing changes to the project efficiently.

The shift toward principles gives project managers more freedom to customize their approaches and practices, making PMBOK 7 more applicable to a broader range of industries and project types.
