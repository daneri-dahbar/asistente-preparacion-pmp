# Performance Domains

An major update in PMBOK 7 is the replacement of the traditional Knowledge Areas with Performance Domains. Instead of categorizing project management activities into specific knowledge areas such as scope, time, cost, and risk management, PMBOM 7 introduces eight Performance Domains that represent key areas of project performance:

1. Stakeholder: Ensuring the ongoing engagement of stakeholders throughout the project lifecycle.
2. Team: Developing and maintaining an effective project team.
3. Development Approach and Life Cycle: Selecting and managing the appropriate development approach for the project.
4. Planning: Organizing and preparin the project effectively.
5. Project Work: Executing and managing project work to meet objectives.
6. Delivery: Focusing on delivering project outcomes that align with stakeholder expectations.
7. Measurement: Monitoring project progress and adapting as necessary.
8. Uncertainty: Addressing risk and opportunities to manage uncertainty.

These domains emphasize project outcomes, team collaboration, and continuous improvement, aligning with agile and adaptive approaches. This allows prohect managers to focus on the valie they are delivering, rather than just followinf a set of rigid processes.
